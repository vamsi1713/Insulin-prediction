# Insulin-prediction

Personalized Insulin Dosage Optimization Using AI-Driven Predictive Analytics: The core problem addressed is the challenge of maintaining optimal blood glucose levels in diabetic patients by determining accurate insulin doses. The project utilizes a real-world dataset containing blood glucose measurements and insulin doses, processed through data cleaning, feature engineering, and time-series structuring. Multiple models were developed, including LSTM, GRU, and an Ensemble of the two, alongside a reinforcement learning approach using the TD3 algorithm. Among these, the Ensemble model demonstrated the best performance with the lowest mean squared error and highest RÂ² scores, indicating better predictive accuracy. The reinforcement learning model, although slightly behind in accuracy, showed potential in dynamic adaptation, which is valuable for real-time dosage adjustment. The implementation involved training, testing, hyperparameter tuning, and continuous monitoring to ensure model robustness. This AI-powered solution offers promising prospects for safer and more personalized insulin therapy, ultimately aiming to improve the quality of life for diabetic individuals.
